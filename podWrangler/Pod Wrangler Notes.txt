*Like the starck, barren look
*On the go is beautiful
*Great scrubber
*Like simplicity of playlist options
*Dislike like the play-in-order nature
*Like the push notifications
*Like the beep between podcasts
*While the icon shows the similarity with Feed Wrangler, it feels uninspired
*On screen podcast controls take up too much room on 4/4S screen (proportion matters)
*Like the layout of main screen, though would put "unheard" at top of the list
*After adding a podcast, it feels like it takes too long to get back to podcast list to listen to newly subscribed podcast
*Ads totally ruined the free version
*Makes sense to bundle podcast and RSS into a single web interface and sister apps
*The fastforward and rewind buttons were not industry standard. Very confusing. Thought I would skip to next podcast instead of skipping 30 secs. Prefer the look of these icons
*Felt like downloads were not always responsive; probably a backend problem
*"Wrangle" wasn't clear that this was how you bulk manage podcasts, though I don't think you could find one word or one icon that would suitably replace "wrangle"
*I like the simple icons for the lists, though they can be imporoved.
*Like the scrolling episode titles when play controls are reduced
*Big artwork from lockscreen
*Fairly granular controls for managing old episodes
*Like info on bulk uploading from other podcatchers
*Slide to right for individual deleting of episodes
*Confirmation for unsubscribing
*Like the web interface
*Syncing is awesome
*Active search - also only one so far to have "accide" lead to ATP at top of list
*Like the sleep timer
*Why is the download list on the top? Also, why are all grayed out? What is the difference between all and downloaded?
