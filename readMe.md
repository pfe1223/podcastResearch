#Podcast Research

With the hopes of creating a podcatcher, here is some initial research on some popular podcasting clients on iOS and Android. The clients reviewed (so far):
* Mozilla Podcasts
* Pod Wrangler
* Overcast
* Pocketcast
* NPR One
* Robert McGinley of [Anxtious Machine] (www.anxiousmachine.com) has a [great video] (http://www.anxiousmachine.com/blog/2014/7/24/the-best-podcasting-apps-for-iphone) on podcatcher reviews and [John Siracusa's thoughts] (http://www.anxiousmachine.com/blog/2014/7/25/john-siracusa-is-right) on the way Overcast does priority playlists.
